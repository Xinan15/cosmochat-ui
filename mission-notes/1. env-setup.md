# Development Environment Setup

## 1. To check if `node` and `npm` are installed

```shell
node -v
npm -v
```

## 2. To create a new react app

```shell
npx create-react-app .
```
To create a react app in the current directory.

```shell
npx create-react-app my-app
```

To create a react app named `my-app` in a new directory named `my-app`.

```shell
npx create-react-app my-app --use-npm
```

To specify using `npm` instead of `yarn` as the package manager.

```shell
npm create-react-app my-app
```

To create a react app using `npm` instead of `npx`.

### Differences between `npx` and `npm`

1. `npm` - Node Package Manager
- Purpose: Installs packages globally or locally.

2. `npx` - Node Package Execute
- Purpose: Runs packages without installing them globally, preventing from global namespace pollution.

### Dependencies

```shell
npm install react-router-dom
npm install axios
npm install redux
npm i package.json
```

- `react-router-dom`: For `routing` in React applications.
- `axios`: For making `HTTP requests`.
- `redux`: For `state management`.
- `package.json`: Contains project metadata and dependencies.

### Run the React app

```shell
npm install / npm i
npm start
```

- `npm install`: Installs the project dependencies.
- `npm start`: Starts the development server.
